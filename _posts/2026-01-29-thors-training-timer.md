Today I released a little pomodoro timer idle game, or desktop timer toy, called
[Thor's Training Timer](https://owlmakesgames.itch.io/thors-training-timer) It's meant to be a pomodoro timer productivity tool, but made a tiny bit more fun.

You use it like a normal pomodoro timer, but you get to watch Thor (or Odin or Sif) beat up a monster while you do your work. They also take little naps during the breaks, which I think is fun. 

You earn gold during your work sessions that you can spend in the shop on new cosmetics - characters, enemies, and backgrounds. Everyone gets to customize the timer to fit what they like!

In many ways this is kind of an anti-game and barely an idle game. That's by design - I had great success getting through college by using the pomodoro technique and I always wanted to make my own. While I don't really use them anymore, it felt like a fun challenge for me to build quickly.

I took a break from Loki's Revenge updates to work on this, and I think it really opened my eyes to how much faster and better I've gotten as a developer since working on Loki. After being kind of burnt out with Loki updates, working on this timer and finishing it within 3 months felt amazing. (To be clear, the 3 months included a few week, if not 1 month break during the holidays and a week or 2 of Loki's Revenge updates)

I know basically no one will play it or care, but it still felt good to start and finish something so quickly. I needed that palette cleanser and confidence boost very badly.

I also had a lot of fun starting to learn Blender to do the 3D logo and kdenlive to edit the [infomercial style release trailer](https://youtu.be/Qtkt8iLDYKc)
